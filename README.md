# S&amp;Box FNAF
FNAF 1, in s&amp;box.

If you're going to use any of this in your own project, all I ask is that you link back to this repo/link to the game (https://sbox.game/dagabey/fnaf) in your game.

This is a bit sinful. A fair bit of it is not made "correctly", but it has been rock solid for the last 2 months. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

# Why are no assets distributed?
A lot of the assets are nabbed from Help Wanted, as I can't model to save my life. Already a gray area distributing them through sbox.game, so I'd rather not push my luck.
